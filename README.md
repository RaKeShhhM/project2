# git init 
creating a new folder and creating a hidden git file in it and uploading to the local git file

1. creating new repo AND copy HTTPS code
2. git remote add origin link and git remote -v will verify
3. git branch gives master as it is the main branch(if multiple people are working in a project they create different projects and merge them together to form the final project)
4. git branch -M main  will change branch name to main
5. git push main origin will do the final job
